Star Wars Save Manager

This application is made in WinForms. It was made for Star Wars speedrunning for switching out savefiles fast, instead for dragging and dropping each savefile as you need them.

This was made quite early in Star Wars speedrunning so it is probably not useful at this moment. It has little functionality outside of it's current.
